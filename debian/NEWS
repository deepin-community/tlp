tlp (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  TLP version 1.3.0 introduces important changes to its configuration scheme.

  The main configuration file has been renamed from "/etc/default/tlp" to
  "/etc/tlp.conf". This file should be automatically renamed during upgrade,
  so any local modification will be carried over.

  Additionally, it's now possible to add local modifications via configuration
  snippets in directory "/etc/tlp.d". Any file present in this directory and
  ending with the ".conf" extension will be read by TLP when it starts. This
  relieves the burden of merging local modifications to the main configuration
  file with each package upgrade, and is now the recommended way to add local
  modifications to TLP's configuration.

  Settings are read in this order:

  - /usr/share/tlp/defaults.conf (intrinsic defaults)
  - /etc/tlp.d/*.conf (drop-in customizations)
  - /etc/tlp.conf (user configuration)

  In case of identical parameters, the last occurrence has precedence.
